## Company Background
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years.


## Problem statement
Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

## Conclusion
Conclusions which are derived from Analysis of Datasets are as follows -

1. The majority of the month's revenue was contributed by a 4.81% decrease in rebuilding efforts in June. Conversely, a 1.55% decline in revenue was observed in July compared to may month. 
Interestingly, cancellation rates, consistently at 24% to 25% across all months, do not appear to be the cause of the sudden drop in revenue.

2. Overall average rating are 3.62 and those are pretty consistent but still needs to look after a rating shown what prescription the past customers carry for your brand from their own experience at the property.

3. Similarly, total bookings displayed minimal variations, averaging between 44k to 46k, while occupancy rates remained relatively stable at 57% to 58% throughout all months.

4. A notable decrease in revenue occurred during weekends in May, and similarly, a sudden decline was observed on weekdays in June.

5. The weekly data on trains confirms our initial findings that the primary reason for the drop in revenue is a decrease in booking %, not the cancellation %. While the cancellation % should certainly be addressed, minimizing the calculations can increase both occupancy % and revenue. However, it is important to note that the root cause lies in the drop in booking %.

6. According to monthly trends, the occupancy percentage and total bookings experienced a decline in July, while the cancellation percentage reached its peak in June. Surprisingly, despite the highest cancellation rate in June, the revenue witnessed a decrease in that same month.

7. MUMBAI is the top most city through out all months. Atliq Palace and atliq exotica are highest contributing hotels. Business hotel contributing less to the revenue as well as their average rating is really a matter of concert essentially atliq seasons.

8. Make our trip is better channel contribution around 19 to 20% to the revenue. However, major revenue around 40% is coming from unrecognized source which needs to identify for better marketing efforts.

9. Bangalore is the city with lowest occupancy rate throughout all months, still it’s the second highest city contributing to revenue. It has noticeable lower cancellation rate as well, However in month of July 2022 its sitting on top compare to its lowest cancellation rate in May 2022. 

10. The Elite class exhibits the highest revenue contribution, yet it concurrently faces the highest cancellation rate and the lowest occupancy rate consistently throughout the months.

11. The presidential class ranks as the second-lowest in terms of revenue contributions. However, it consistently maintains a higher occupancy percentage throughout all months. Another notable aspect is its cancellation rate, which stands as the lowest throughout each month.
